Whenever we refer to “current” or “present” in this exercise, we refer to the date returned by the built-in NOW() function. Additionally, take a look at DATE_PART() function provided by PostgreSQL [LINK](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-datetime.html). It is useful if you want to extract the year, month, etc. of a date.


What is the current highest salary in each department if we only consider people people who have been hired at the company before 1990?
