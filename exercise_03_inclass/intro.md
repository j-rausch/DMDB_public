# Welcome!

This scenario accompanies Exercise 3 of the DMDB lecture.

It automatically sets up a DBMS in Ubuntu to use for the exercises that are presented in the course.

Alternatively, you can use [this scenario](https://www.katacoda.com/dmdb2020/scenarios/exercise_03_auto) to manually go through the set-up step by step.

Please wait until all commands have been executed before using the interactive bash terminal.
